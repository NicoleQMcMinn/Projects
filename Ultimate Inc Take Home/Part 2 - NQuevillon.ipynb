    "The neighboring cities of Gotham and Metropolis have complementary circadian rhythms: on weekdays, Ultimate Gotham is most active at night, and Ultimate Metropolis is most active during the day. On weekends, there is reasonable activity in both cities.\n",
    "However, a toll bridge, with a two way toll, between the two cities causes driver partners to tend to be exclusive to each city. The Ultimate managers of city operations for the two cities have proposed an experiment to encourage driver partners to be available in both cities, by reimbursing all toll costs."

    "An experiment that I would recommend to assess the effectiveness of reimbursing all toll costs in order to increase the driver partners offering their services in both cities would involve **splitting our active driver base in the two cities into an Experiment and Control group.

    "The size of the groups and the length of the experiment would depend on the current size of the driver base, what level of confidence we want in order to declare the experiment a success or failure, and how long we expect it to take for drivers to adjust their behaviour if they were goign to do so. These would be decided on during experiment design.\n",

We would use the t-test (use if normally distributed, use Mann-Whitney U test if not) to compare the change in the percent of drivers. We want to be able to confidently reject the hypothesis that reimbursing toll fees does not influence driver partners to service both cities. **The result of this will tell us what degree of confidence we have that there is a difference in the behaviour of driver partners between the Experiment and Control groups.** If the p-value result is less than the confidence level established before the experiment, we can call the experiement a success.\n",

    "*   The experiemnt would be declared a success if we are confident in a positive change in behavioural change. It does not indicate the success of any other metrics such as financial.\n",
    "*   To be successful, **this experiment must be able to be run without the two groups knowing about each other.** If this isn't possible, we should design a different experiment. For example, if a driver in the control group knew there were other drivers getting toll reimbursements, they may be even less likely to offer services in both cities, hence impacting our final metric\n",
